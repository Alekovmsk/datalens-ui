// separate file, because there are places like preview, for example, where base.scss is needed,
// but min-width is not needed, on the entries/landing level (LandingPage imports base.scss)

// import this only in scss files!
// if you try to import this in js file, then its style reach the common.css add break min-width for dash and public
